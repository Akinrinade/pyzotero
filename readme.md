# Description #

Because it's 2011, and I have no intention of using PHP for anything, let alone writing it, this is a first pass at implementing a Python wrapper for the [Zotero API][1]. There's no use case as yet, since I'm not sure what's going to be the ultimate consumer of the returned data. Expect a lot of initial fragility, if not outright breakage.
